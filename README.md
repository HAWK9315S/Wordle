## Project Title : Flet Wordle Clone Game

This project implements a clone of the popular word-guessing game Wordle using Pysthon DSA and Flet library. Players attempt to guess a five-letter word within six tries. After each guess, the letters are color-coded to indicate correctness (green for correct position, yellow for correct letter but wrong position, and gray for incorrect letter). The game includes a user-friendly interface, responsive animations, and helpful error messages to enhance the gameplay experience

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to guess a 5-letter word within six tries. After each guess, the letters will change color to indicate how close you are to the correct word:

* Green: The letter is in the correct spot.
* Yellow: The letter is in the word, but in the wrong spot.
* Black: The letter is not in the word.
